Movie Recommendation System using SVD
A collaborative filtering recommendation system that uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user movie preferences and suggest similar movies.
Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation engine using SVD algorithm. The system:

Predicts user movie ratings based on collaborative filtering
Recommends movies to users based on predicted preferences
Finds similar movies using cosine similarity in latent factor space
Evaluates model performance using RMSE and MAE metrics
